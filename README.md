# HomePass

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

**Shareable guest links for controlling Home Assistant devices**

Create time-limited links that give guests control of specific Home Assistant
entities — lights, locks, thermostats, fans, and more. Guests get a
mobile-friendly PWA with real-time state updates. No HA accounts needed, no app
installs, just a link.

## Features

- **Scoped guest tokens** — each token grants access to a specific set of entities
- **Time-limited access** — tokens expire after a chosen duration, or never
- **Scheduled start** — an optional "valid from" time; the expiry is measured from the start, not from creation
- **Optional PIN** — a 4–8 digit PIN on top of the link, enforced on every guest endpoint,
  with revocable links that skip it and a per-link choice of whether it is remembered
- **Proximity requirement** — mark individual entities as usable only from inside HA's `zone.home`
- **Per-entity overrides** — rename an entity for the guest, and opt lights into a brightness slider and colour controls
- **Camera streaming** — read-only live views; no `camera.*` service is reachable
- **Entity templates and label filtering** — save a named selection, filter the picker by HA label, bulk-add every match
- **Slug rotation** — mint a new link for an existing token and retire the old one
- **Real-time updates** — SSE-powered live state changes with automatic reconnect
- **Installable PWA** — guests can add it to their home screen for an app-like experience
- **Dark mode** — system-aware with manual override
- **Admin dashboard** — create, revoke, extend, and monitor tokens
- **Recent activity** — see guest link opens and commands in the admin dashboard
- **Service allowlist** — only the services a domain's guest controls actually call are permitted
- **Rate limiting** — 300 requests/minute and 3000 requests/hour per token on commands
- **IP allowlisting** — optionally restrict tokens to specific CIDRs

## Installation

### Home Assistant Add-on (recommended)

1. Add this repository in **Settings → Add-ons → Add-on Store → ⋮ → Repositories**:

   ```
   https://github.com/ljmerza/homepass
   ```

2. Find **HomePass** in the store and click **Install**.
3. Go to the **Configuration** tab and set your options.
4. Start the add-on.
5. Click **Open Web UI** or find HomePass in the HA sidebar.

Admin access works through the HA sidebar — no separate login needed. Guest
links use the direct port (`http://<your-ha-ip>:5880/g/{slug}`) so visitors
don't need HA accounts.

### Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  homepass:
    image: ghcr.io/ljmerza/homepass:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 5880:5880
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
    environment:
      - ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
      - ADMIN_PASSWORD=changeme
      - HA_BASE_URL=http://homeassistant.local:8123
      - HA_TOKEN=your_long_lived_token_here
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Docker Run

```bash
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 5880:5880 \
  -v ./data:/data \
  -e ADMIN_USERNAME=admin \
  -e ADMIN_PASSWORD=changeme \
  -e HA_BASE_URL=http://homeassistant.local:8123 \
  -e HA_TOKEN=your_long_lived_token_here \
  ghcr.io/ljmerza/homepass:latest
```

The admin dashboard is at `http://localhost:5880/admin/dashboard`.

> **Note:** Docker deployments need a [long-lived access token](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/auth_api/#long-lived-access-token) from Home Assistant. Create one in your HA profile under **Security → Long-Lived Access Tokens**, from a user with **Administrator** enabled — Home Assistant only lets admins POST to `/api/events/`, so a non-admin token runs guest commands fine but cannot fire HomePass's activity events. The add-on handles this automatically.

## Home Assistant Activity Events

HomePass emits a `homepass_activity` event after a valid guest page load and after
a successful guest command. These events are best-effort notification hooks:
HomePass logs and drops event failures without blocking the guest. HomePass also
writes matching Home Assistant Logbook entries for the Activity view.

Event payloads do not include the guest slug, internal token ID, or client IP
address.

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "activity": "command",
  "token_label": "Cleaner",
  "target_entity_id": "lock.front_door",
  "service": "lock.unlock"
}
```

`activity` is either `page_load` or `command`. `page_load` means the guest link
URL was requested; link previews, scanners, stale bookmarks, and refreshes can
also trigger it. Use `command` for higher-signal notifications.

```yaml
alias: HomePass guest activity notification
triggers:
  - trigger: event
    event_type: homepass_activity
conditions:
  - condition: template
    value_template: "{{ trigger.event.data.activity == 'command' }}"
actions:
  - action: notify.mobile_app_phone
    data:
      title: "Guest access"
      message: >
        {{ trigger.event.data.token_label }} used
        {{ trigger.event.data.service }}
        on {{ trigger.event.data.target_entity_id }}
```

## Supported Entity Types

### Controllable Domains

Each domain lists exactly the services its guest control calls, and nothing more.

| Domain | Allowed Services |
|---|---|
| `light` | `turn_on`, `turn_off`, `toggle` |
| `switch` | `turn_on`, `turn_off`, `toggle` |
| `input_boolean` | `turn_on`, `turn_off`, `toggle` |
| `group` | `turn_on`, `turn_off`, `toggle` |
| `climate` | `set_temperature`, `set_hvac_mode`, `turn_on`, `turn_off` |
| `lock` | `lock`, `unlock`, `open` |
| `alarm_control_panel` | `alarm_arm_home`, `alarm_arm_away`, `alarm_arm_night`, `alarm_disarm` |
| `media_player` | `media_play`, `media_pause`, `media_stop`, `volume_set`, `media_play_pause`, `turn_on`, `turn_off` |
| `cover` | `open_cover`, `close_cover`, `stop_cover` |
| `fan` | `turn_on`, `turn_off`, `toggle`, `set_percentage` |
| `button` | `press` |
| `time` | `set_value` |
| `datetime` | `set_value` |

### Helper Domains

Home Assistant helpers, from **Settings → Devices & Services → Helpers**.

| Domain | Allowed Services |
|---|---|
| `input_number` | `set_value` |
| `input_text` | `set_value` |
| `input_select` | `select_option` |
| `input_datetime` | `set_datetime` |
| `input_button` | `press` |
| `counter` | `increment`, `decrement`, `reset` |
| `timer` | `start`, `pause`, `cancel` |

### Read-Only Domains

| Domain | Access |
|---|---|
| `sensor` | Real-time state display only |
| `binary_sensor` | Real-time state display only |
| `camera` | Live view only — every `camera.*` service is refused |
| `schedule` | Current state only — its services rewrite the whole weekly schedule |

`script`, `scene` and `automation` are excluded on purpose: they run arbitrary
automations and bypass entity scoping. `alarm_control_panel.alarm_trigger` is
excluded for the same reason — no arm/disarm widget needs to set off a siren.

## Guest Link Options

Every option below is set per link, either when the link is created or afterwards
from the token's card in the admin dashboard.

### Expiry and scheduled start

Pick a preset duration (1 hour through 1 year), a custom one, or **Never
expires**. **Valid From** is optional and takes a future date and time: the link
can be shared straight away but answers "not active yet" with a countdown until
the start, and the duration runs from that start rather than from creation. A
3-day link scheduled for next Friday is three days of access beginning next
Friday. **Activate Now** opens a scheduled link early without moving its expiry.

### PIN

A 4–8 digit PIN, optional and off by default. With one set, the link shows a PIN
screen first, and every guest endpoint behind it — the page, the state feed, the
SSE stream, commands and both camera routes — is refused until the PIN is
entered. A correct entry lasts 24 hours, or until the link expires, whichever is
sooner.

PINs are bcrypt-hashed and write-only. The dashboard reports whether a link has
one; it can never show you what it is. **A forgotten PIN is replaced, not
recovered** — set a new one. Setting or clearing a PIN signs out every guest who
had already entered the old one.

**Remember PIN** is per link and on by default. Off, the PIN session is a
browser-session cookie (no `Max-Age`), so the guest enters the PIN again on
their next visit; the signed 24-hour expiry still applies on top. Turning it off
signs out sessions that were being remembered.

**Links without PIN** (`/g/{slug}?c=<code>`) are minted from the dashboard with
an optional label. The code is 192 random bits, returned once and stored as a
SHA-256 hash. Opening one checks it in constant time against that token's links,
rate-limited per IP and per link, sets the same PIN session cookie a correct PIN
would, and redirects to the bare `/g/{slug}` so the code leaves the address bar.
The code is honoured on that page only — never on `/state`, `/stream`,
`/command` or the camera routes — and skips the PIN but not the IP allowlist,
expiry or revocation. The session it sets names the link, so revoking or
rotating a link signs out the devices it let in. Changing or clearing the PIN,
or rotating the slug, deletes every link. Up to 20 per token.

### Proximity requirement

Per entity, off by default. With it on, pressing that one control asks the
guest's browser where it is, and the command only goes through if the position
falls inside Home Assistant's `zone.home`. Everything else on the link is
unaffected, and a link with nothing gated never references the geolocation API at
all.

Two limitations, both real:

- **The link has to be served over HTTPS.** Browsers withhold location on plain
  HTTP, so the control refuses rather than quietly passing.
- **The position is self-reported by the browser.** A guest willing to edit the
  request can claim to be anywhere. Treat it as friction against casual use of
  the link from elsewhere — the same caveat the IP allowlist carries — not as
  proof anyone is at the door.

It fails closed: no fix, a fix older than two minutes, or a `zone.home` that
cannot be read all refuse the command.

### Per-entity display options

Open any selected entity in the picker to set:

- **Display name** — up to 64 characters, shown to the guest instead of the Home
  Assistant name. Blank falls back to the HA name.
- **Show brightness slider** (lights) — off by default; the guest gets on/off only.
- **Show colour controls** (lights) — off by default. The guest gets an RGB wheel,
  a warm–cool temperature slider, or both, depending on what Home Assistant
  reports the light supports.

Neither light toggle gates the command path — putting a light on a link is what
grants `light.turn_on`. They decide what the guest UI draws.

### Entity templates, labels and rotation

- **Templates** — save the picker's current selection under a name and load it
  into a later link. Loading adds to the selection rather than replacing it, and
  entities Home Assistant no longer has are dropped.
- **Label filter** — filter the picker by Home Assistant label, and **Add all**
  every entity matching the current filter. Labels are read over HA's WebSocket
  API; if they cannot be read the filter is hidden rather than shown empty.
- **Rotate Link** — mints a new slug for an existing token. The old link stops
  working immediately, including any open SSE stream. Entities, overrides,
  expiry, PIN and access history survive, and a guest holding a PIN session is
  asked for the PIN again. Links without PIN are deleted.

### IP allowlist

An optional comma-separated list of CIDRs, set when the link is created. It
requires a reverse proxy that overwrites `X-Forwarded-For` with the real client
address; without one, a client can claim any address it likes.

## Limits

Hardcoded, not configurable.

| Limit | Value |
|---|---|
| Guest commands | 300/minute and 3000/hour, per link |
| Camera snapshots | 120/minute, per link |
| Concurrent camera streams | 8, per link |
| Refused proximity checks | 5/minute and 30/hour, per link |
| PIN attempts | 5/minute and 20/hour per IP; 15/minute and 100/hour per link |
| Link-without-PIN checks | 10/minute and 60/hour per IP; 30/minute and 300/hour per link |
| Admin login attempts | 5/minute per IP |
| Access log retention | 90 days, via `ACCESS_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS` |

The command allowance is deliberately loose on the short window: the colour wheel
streams throttled updates for as long as the guest drags it. The hourly cap is
the real ceiling.
